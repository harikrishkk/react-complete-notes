# Effects, reducers, context

Main job - user interacts, UI renders & re-renders

- Evaluate , render jsx,
- manage state, props, react to user input.
- when state / prop changes, re-evaluate component

## Side effects

- API requests
- timeouts
- Browser storage

## useEffect hook

[UseEffect example with reqres](https://codesandbox.io/s/07useeffect-6l8y0)

## With pagination

[Example with pagination](https://codesandbox.io/s/07useeffect-with-pagination-ze3uu)

## Side effects

- Render UI, react to user inputs, re-render UI
- An effect is something like an API call.
- Storing in local storage, intervals, timeouts.

```
Will trigger when a state change
useEffect(() => {});

Same as component did mount
useEffect(() => {

},[]);

Rerun when any of the dependencies change
useEffect(() => {

},[props])
```

- useEffect is there to handle side effects.

## Clean ups

[Clean up example](https://codesandbox.io/s/07useeffect-cleanup-5p0ie)

- It runs before every side effects
- We can use the cleanup for things like debounce.
-

## useReducer

- Helps with state management
- When multiple state needs to be managed together.
- We may use many slices with useState, rather we use the useReducer

[UseReducer example](https://codesandbox.io/s/09usereducer-g51f8)

We can also create a `reducer.js` and cut paste the reducer logic into that file.

[UseReducer with separate file](https://codesandbox.io/s/09usereducer-reducer-separate-file-49txk)

Note: When we pass deps, make sure its a property & not an object
Since, the useEffect runs when any of the property within the object changes, which may not be desirable.

## useState vs useReducer

- useState - single independant props
- useReducer - state updates have grouped proeprty that updates together

## React context

If we start forwarding state to nested components, we can consider this alternative.

[React context example](https://codesandbox.io/s/10react-context-y4qfp)

As a shortcut, for consumers, copy from here.

```
<AuthContext.Consumer>
    {
        (context) => {
        return (

        );
      }
    }
</AuthContext.Consumer>
```

As a part of refactor, auth-context can wrap the whole logic
so that App.js is lean

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const AuthContext = React.createContext({
  isLoggedIn: false,
  toggle: () => {},
});

export const AuthContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

  const onLogin = () => {
    setIsLoggedIn((prevLogin) => !prevLogin);
  };

  const state = {
    isLoggedIn,
    toggle: onLogin,
  };
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={state}>{props.children}</AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default AuthContext;

```

and in App.js, we just use that component which encapsulates whole logic.

```
import { AuthContextProvider } from './context/auth-context';

  return (
    <AuthContextProvider>
      <Header />
       ...
    </AuthContextProvider>
  );
```

- we use context when we need to pass state down to deeply nested copmponents.
- We dont need to forward data down the tree.

## Is context a state management replacement?

It can be used for state managment across the whole app. But, limitations being,
context is not optimized for high freqency changes. Thats better done by redux.

eg: Authentication, Localization can be possible candidates for context

It doesnt give access to dev tools.

## Rules for hooks

- Only call hooks within react functions / custom hooks.
- Should not be used within class components
- Call them only at top level, not in block statements or nested functions.
- For useEffect, make sure, we provide deps.

## Forward refs

If we have a method within a component that needs to be called from outside
of it, we can use forwardRef

useImperativeHandle - is another way of using the functionaliy imperatively.

```

 for a component, along with the props, we get ref as the second param
 The second param object should contain everything we can use from outside.
 To enable ref, we need to wrap the same with forwardRef
 That pretty much means, its still a react component, but capable of being bound to a ref.

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    return {
      focus: activate,
    };
  });
```

Create an input component

```
import React, { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from "react";

// This needs to be wrapped in forwardRef, and pass "ref"

const Input = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {

  const inputRef = useRef();

  const activate = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

// This is like an adapter

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    return {
      focus: activate,
    };
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <label> {props.label} </label>
      <input ref={inputRef} name={props.name} />
    </div>
  );
});

export default Input;

```

we are exposing functionality from a component to its parent to be called
and used from the parent.

And in the parent component

```
import { useContext, useRef } from "react";
import Input from "./Input";

const User = (props) => {

  const usernameRef = useRef();
  const passwordRef = useRef();

  const activate = () => {
    usernameRef.current.focus();
  };
  const activatePswd = () => {
    passwordRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <Input ref={usernameRef}
        label="User Name" name="username" />
        <Input ref={passwordRef}
        label="Password" name="password" />
        <button onClick={activate}>
          focus
        </button>
        <button onClick={activatePswd}>
          focus pswd
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

```

In theory, we need to trigger the focus method from outside by calling activate()
For edge cases like focus, scroll etc , we can use this as last resort.
