# State and events

- Declarative approach
- UI is a function of state.
- Component is just a function. So react needs to call the function to update them.
- updater function re-renders the component.
- The updater function is asynchronous.
- State is on a per-component instance for useState.

## Adding event listeners / Using Objects instead of single slices of state

[Event listeners and objects](https://codesandbox.io/s/05working-with-state-goydz)

We need a key, as well as for updating, we can also have the functional syntax.

```
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setItem(() => {
      return {
        ...item,
        [e.target.name]: e.target.value
      };
    });
  };
```

Here, we passed the data from the Form component to its parent.

## Lifting state:

When we need to share state, we may need to lift them to a level where the parent can share them to all the child components below.

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled component

- The value is passed on to a parent component.
- Its received from the parent component
- Logic resides in parent component.
- Value & changes to the value reside in parent component.

## key points

- We use `map()` to loop through collection.
- We need a key for each instance.
- To output items conditionally,
- We can store JSX content in variables.

## To conditionally show / hide item, we can use

```
{ isAvailable && <p> { message} </p> }
{ isAvailable ? <p> { message} </p> : <p> Sorry , out of stock! </p> }
```
