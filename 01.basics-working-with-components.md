# Features

- Component driven UI.
- Interactive & Scalable UI.

## What are components ?

- React simplifies interactive & reactive UI development.
- React is all about components.
- All UI in the end is made up of a bunch of components. ( HTML + CSS + JS )
- Reusable, reactive components & seperation of concerns.
- Single responsibility principle.
- DRY, Declarative, functions are split into smaller pieces.
- we can create app-header, app-footer
- HTML + CSS + JS inside components in a declarative manner.
- We define the desired target state & let react figure out how to render the same in real DOM. ie, UI is a function of state.
- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
- React code is just javascript code. We can use JSX syntax.
- Our code (es6 features, imports, etc is not understood by browsers by default ) is transformed by the workflow.
- index.js is the starting point of the application.
- A component is just a function that returns JSX.
- We can add a css/scss

## Installation

- We need Node js to be installed. Its a runtime for JS.
- The tooling & webpack need node.

```

- package.json has all dependencies.
- index.js is executed initially.
- we see css imported inside js
- webpack workflow takes care of everything.
- react and react-dom are two packages.

```
App is a component, and we instantiate them via <App />
```

## JSX

- We just mention the desired target state.
- Javascript XML ie HTML inside Javascript.
- HTMLish ( htmlFor, className, etc )
- We should return one root element from within a JSX.
- Need a wrapper / Fragment
- Always keep the JSX lean.

## Custom component

- shortcut = `rafce` or `rcc`

### Create a new component

[Create a Custom Card component](https://codesandbox.io/s/02card-component-yxqj6)

To add styling, we can add css or scss files.
We need to tell the build process to consider these extensions.

In `src/assets`, place the image that we referred above.

_Earlier, we needed to import React everywhere. But moving forward, we dont need them. Though its okay to put them if we like._

Note, component need an uppercase starting character to distinguish the same from regular HTML components.

### To pass inputs into the component via props

[Create a Custom Card with props](https://codesandbox.io/s/02card-component-with-props-yocvj)

## We can pass content via props.children

[Passing props via children](https://codesandbox.io/s/02card-component-with-props-children-v1h8b)

Now, we can pass anything into this as children from its parent.

## To loop through arrays of items,

## Add a rating ( component composition )

[Component composition](https://codesandbox.io/s/04component-composition-ne25h)

JSX gets converted into React.createElement() calls. Use babel to see transformation.
We need one element as the root element that needs to be returned.

## File organizations

```
Can have /components folder , /utils folder , /shared or /ui folder.
```
