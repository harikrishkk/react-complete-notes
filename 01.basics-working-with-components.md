# Features 

- Component driven UI.
- Interactive & Scalable UI.

## What are components ?

- React simplifies interactive & reactive UI development. 
- React is all about components.
- All UI in the end is made up of components. 
- Reusable & seperation of concerns.
- DRY, Declarative 
- we can create app-header, app-footer
- HTML + CSS + JS inside components in a declarative manner. 
- We change state & react renders UI based on the state.  UI is a function of state. 
- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
- React code is just javascript code.  We can use JSX syntax 
- Our code (es6 features, imports, etc is not understood by browsers by default ) is transformed by the workflow.
- index.js is the starting point of the application. 
- A component is just a function that returns JSX. 
- We can add a css/scss 

## JSX

- Javascript XML 
- HTMLish ( htmlFor, className, etc )
- We should return one root element from within a JSX. 
- Need a wrapper / Fragment 
- Always keep the JSX lean. 

## Custom component 

- shortcut = **rafce** or **rcc**

### Create a new component 

```

import './my_own_styles.css';

const HelloWorld = () => {
  const name = "React";
  return <div className="my_styles">Hello from { name } </div>;
};

export default HelloWorld;

```

*Earlier, we needed to import React everywhere. But moving forward, we dont need them. Though its okay to put them if we like.* 

and to use the component, we import the same in App.js 

```
import HelloWorld from "./components/HelloWorld";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <HelloWorld />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note, we need an uppercase to distinguish the same from regular HTML components.

### To pass inputs into the component via props

```

const HelloWorld = (props) => {
  const { name } = props;  
  return <div className="my_styles">Hello from { name } </div>;
};

<!--- we just need to add an attribute -->

<HelloWorld name="React"/>

```

We can also destructure the props as 

```
const HelloWorld = ({ name }) => {

}
```

## We can pass content via props.children 

```
<Card>
   <img />
</Card>

<!--- and can use it via props.children -->

const HelloWorld = ({ children }) => {
  <div> 
    { children }
  </div>
}

```

## File organizations 

Can have /components folder , /utils folder , /shared or /ui folder.
