# Class based components

- Modern way is with functional components.
- Previously, we had classes. Error boundaries requires class components.
- Prior to 16.8, we used class components to manage state & side effects.
- With hooks, we could use functional components everywhere.
- Class based components cannot use `hooks`.

```
import { Component } from 'react'

export default class Cart extends Component {
  state = {
    name : "",
    age : 10
  }
  updateHandler = () => {
    const { userName } = this.props;
    this.setState(prevState => {
        return {
            name: userName
        }
    });
  }
  render() {
    const { name } = this.state;
    return (
      <div>
        <p> { name } </p>
        <button onClick={this.updateHandler}> Update </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

```

Its just that this requires a mental model.

We need to use "this" inside of the class.

setState merges the state with existing state, whereas, useState overwrites the existing state.

We need to use this.updateHandler.bind(this) if we use the non-arrow function syntax.

```
  updateHandler() {
    const { userName } = this.props;
    this.setState(prevState => {
        return {
            name: userName
        }
    });
  }
<button onClick={this.updateHandler.bind(this)}> Update </button>
```

## Lifecycle hooks

- componentDidMount() - good for API calls. Just will run once on initial load.
- componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) - when component is re-evaluated
- componentWillUnmount() - good for clean ups.

we replace these with the useEffect() with its various forms.
( empty deps, with deps, with clean up return )

## Context

With class based components, the only thing that is changed, is the way we use them.

- We can use the `<Context.Consumer>` syntax in both functional & class components.

- We can connect to **only one context**, within class based components.

```
class User extends Component {
  static contextType = UserContext;
}
```

## Error boundaries

- If there is errors we cannot prevent.
- eg: HTTP and server is offline.

ErrorBoundary.js component.

- not available in functional components
- triggers when one of the child components throw an error

```
class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  state = {
      error: null,
      message: ''
  }
  componentDidCatch(error) {
      this.setState({
          error: true,
          message: error.message
      })
  }
  render() {
    if(this.state.error){
        return <p> Some error </p>
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
export default ErrorBoundary;
```

and can wrap around any components that can potentially throw an error.

```
<ErrorBoundary>
  <UsersList />
</ErrorBoundary>
```
