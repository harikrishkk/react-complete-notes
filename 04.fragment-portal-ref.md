# Fragment, Portal, Ref

- JSX has limitation of having one root element. We can have adjacent root siblings by wrapping a fragment. So, the layouts wont be affected.

- `<React.Fragment>` can be used.
- Or, we an also use empty tags `<> </>`

## Portals

- For things like Modal, we would like to have them at the top most of the tree. Semantically, it should be an overlay and above everything else. For accessibility purpose, it can affect. A direct child of the body is preferrable.

[Portal example](https://codesandbox.io/s/06portals-b8ebk)

Check the console and see where the model ended up in DOM. In index.html, we put a div `backdrop`.

## Ref

- Aka references.
- They allow us to get access to DOM
- To just read the value, we can use Refs.
- With Refs, we setup a connection between the HTML element & JS code.

[Example with refs](https://codesandbox.io/s/07refs-5myek)

A real DOM node element will be assigned to ref. We get an object with a current prop which holds the actual value.

Do not use Refs to manipulate the DOM.

If we just need to read the value, and dont plan to change anything, refs are fine. We wont be storing state anywhere.

So _nameInputRef.current.value_ will hold the value of the input. To reset the value.

```
 nameInputRef.current.value = '';
```

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

- With ref, its uncontrolled. The value is not controlled by React.
- We dont feed data back into input.
