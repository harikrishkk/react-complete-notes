# Fragment, Portal, Ref

- JSX has limitation of having one root element. We can have adjacent root siblings by wrapping a fragment. So, the layouts wont be affected.

- <React.Fragment> can be used.

## Portals

- For things like Modal, we would like to have them at the top most of the tree. Semantically, it should be an overlay and above everything else. For accessibility purpose, it can affect. A direct child of the body is preferrable.

In index.html

```
<div id="backdrop"></div>
<div id="root"></div>
```

We can tell that, the component should be rendered inside the above placeholder.

```
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

{ ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <BackDrop onClick={handler}>,
    document.querySelector('#backdrop')
 )}
```

## Ref

- Aka references.
- They allow us to get access to DOM
- To just read the value, we can use Refs.

```
import { useRef } from 'react'

const Person = () => {
   const nameInputRef =  useRef();
   ...
   <input ref={nameInputRef}/>
}

```

A real DOM node element will be assigned to ref. We get an object with a current prop which holds the actual value.

So _nameInputRef.current.value_ will hold the value of the input. To reset the value

```
 nameInputRef.current.value = '';
```

Controlled vs Uncontrolled

- With ref, its uncontrolled.
